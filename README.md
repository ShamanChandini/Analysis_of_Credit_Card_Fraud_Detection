# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
For any bank or financial organization, credit card fraud detection is of utmost importance. 
We have to spot potential fraud so that consumers can not bill for goods that they haven’t purchased. 
The aim is, therefore, to create a classifier that indicates whether a requested transaction is a fraud.

I've used Random forest algorithm for classification of the credit card dataset.
Random Forest is an algorithm for classification and regression. Summarily, it is a collection of decision tree classifiers.
Random forest has advantage over decision tree as it corrects the habit of over fitting to their training set.

Even for large data sets with many features and data instances training is extremely fast in random forest and because each tree is trained independently of the others. The Random Forest algorithm has been found to provide a good estimate of the generalization error and to be resistant to over fitting.
